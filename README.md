# Hi, I'm Akash ðŸ‘‹
I am an Embedded Systems Engineer passionate about Machine Learning, Deep learning, and Computer Vision. My expertise lies in optimizing and deploying ML models on embedded platforms, particularly in the automotive sector. I am experienced in working with frameworks such as PyTorch and TensorFlow, and I have a strong foundation in computer vision using OpenCV.

This profile hosts some of the academic and personal projects I have done and projects I did as part of online training courses.  



## ðŸŽ“ Master's Project 
- [**Optical Plant Detection for Farming Vehicles**](https://github.com/awsmak/Optical-Plant-Identification-for-Farming-Vehicles-.git): Real-time plant detection system using custom YOLOv3 and EfficientDet Lite models, implemented on Raspberry Pi.

## ðŸš€ ML and DL Projects
- [**Retina Blood Vessel Segmentation**](https://github.com/awsmak/retina_blood_vessel_segmentation.git): A UNET-based segmentation model for detecting blood vessels in retina images using PyTorch.
- [**COVID-19 Detection Using Chest X-Rays**](https://github.com/awsmak/Covid19-detection-using-X-Ray-images-TensorFlow-and-Keras-.git): Classifies chest X-ray images into 'Covid19' or 'Normal' using CNNs built in TensorFlow and Keras.

## ðŸš€Projects associated with courses
- [**MyCUDAPrograms**](https://github.com/awsmak/MyCudaPrograms.git): Projects associated with Udemy coarse CUDA master class.
- [**Snake game using turtile graphics**](https://github.com/awsmak/Snake-game-using-turtle-graphics.git): A UNET-based segmentation model for detecting blood vessels in retina images using PyTorch.


## ðŸ“œ Publications
- **Segmentation and Analysis of Lumbar Spine MRI Scans**: Presented at the European Symposium on Artificial Neural Networks, Computational Intelligence, and Machine Learning (ESANN) in 2023.
